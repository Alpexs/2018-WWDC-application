# 2018-WWDC-application

This is my application for the WWDC 2018 scolarship, I was thinking of something to let people express their creativity, and I tought about a game to do so. A game where you create your character and your enemies. I wanted it to be quite minimalist, that's why there is a single button to interact with. I wanted also to use UIKit alongside of SpriteKit just to see if it was possible... and it is ! So the concept is quite easy, you jump to avoid the obstacles you drew and try to do the best score !
